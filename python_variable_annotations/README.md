# Python - Variable Annotations

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on advanced Python concepts, especially type annotations.

## Description
You will learn how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types, understand duck typing, and validate your code with mypy. All code follows the pycodestyle style guide and includes proper documentation for modules, functions, and classes.

## Learning Objectives
- Type annotations in Python 3
- How to use type annotations for function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.9
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All modules, classes, and functions have documentation
- All files are executable
- Code uses pycodestyle (version 2.5.)

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Python scripts in the `python_variable_annotations` folder. You can validate type annotations using mypy:

```bash
mypy python_variable_annotations/
```
