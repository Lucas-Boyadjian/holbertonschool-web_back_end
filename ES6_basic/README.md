# ES6 Basics

## Description
This project aims to familiarize you with the basic features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a modern version of JavaScript. You will learn to use concepts such as constants, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread operators, and much more.

## Features
This project covers the following concepts:
1. **Constants and block-scoped variables** (`const`, `let`)
2. **Arrow functions** (`=>`)
3. **Default parameters for functions**
4. **Rest operator (`...`)** to collect arguments
5. **Spread operator (`...`)** to expand arrays or objects
6. **String interpolation** (template literals)
7. **Object creation and ES6 methods**
8. **Modern loops and iterations**
9. **ES6 Modules** (`import` and `export`)
