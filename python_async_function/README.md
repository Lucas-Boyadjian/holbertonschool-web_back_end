# Python Async Function Project

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio library.

## Description
You will learn how to create and manage coroutines, tasks, and measure execution time using async/await syntax. The exercises cover launching multiple coroutines, measuring runtime, and working with asyncio.Task objects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand async/await syntax in Python
- Use asyncio to run concurrent coroutines
- Create and manage asyncio.Task objects
- Measure execution time of asynchronous code

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.9
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All modules, classes, and functions have documentation
- All files are executable
- Code uses pycodestyle (version 2.5.)

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Python scripts in the `python_async_function` folder. You can test the asynchronous functions using the provided main files and the asyncio library.
